<h1> My First project! </h1>
My new journey in life has started, I am currently going through web development bootcamp, this is where i'll throw in some of my stuff.
I've currently experimented with:
<ul>
  <li>HTML - Beginner & Intermediate</li>
  <li>CSS - Beginner & Intermediate</li>
</ul>

And im currently messing about with Bootstrap, but what I'm really excited about is JS, i think i'll feel more comfortable and more at home with it.
